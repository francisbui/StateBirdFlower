# State Bird Flower
State Birds and Flowers is a Java application that will print the state bird along with the state flower based on the state the user provides. The program is written for a Command-Line Interface that stores the data in an array. The user will input the state they choose and the system will return that state's corresponding bird and flower. The characters are not case sensitive and will also allow for any leading and trailing spaces. This project was done as an early Java assignment to store data in a multidimensional array that can be retrieved via based on the user's input.
